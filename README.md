# Seattle Airbnb Price Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the Seattle Airbnb dataset to uncover valuable insights about pricing trends, neighborhood popularity, and factors influencing listing prices. By analyzing this data, the goal is to provide recommendations that can help both hosts and travelers make informed decisions. The findings could assist hosts in optimizing their pricing strategies and help travelers better understand the market dynamics in Seattle.

## Business Problem
Airbnb hosts often face challenges when determining optimal pricing for their listings. This project aims to answer critical business questions, including:
- Which neighborhoods are the most popular among travelers?
- How do prices fluctuate based on time and location?
- What factors influence listing prices the most?

## Modeling Approach
In this analysis, the following steps were followed:
1. **Data Collection**: We used the Seattle Airbnb dataset, which includes over 10,000 listings with details such as price, location, amenities, and reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values were handled and categorical variables were appropriately encoded for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We examined key features such as neighborhood, room type, and availability to identify trends and patterns in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features influencing pricing were identified, including location, number of rooms, and guest reviews.
5. **Analysis**: We explored how different factors such as time of year, neighborhood, and property characteristics impact listing prices.

## Results
Several important insights were uncovered:
1. **Neighborhood Popularity**: Certain neighborhoods, like Capitol Hill and Belltown, are more popular among travelers.
2. **Price Fluctuations**: Prices tend to vary depending on the time of year and the neighborhood location.
3. **Key Pricing Factors**: Factors such as the number of bedrooms, room type, and guest reviews have a significant impact on pricing.

By understanding these trends, Airbnb hosts can better tailor their pricing strategies, and travelers can gain insights into where to find the best deals based on their preferences.
